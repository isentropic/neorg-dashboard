# What this is?

Say you have a norg file full of todos or some other information
(currently watching only specs.norg), you can live watch the rendered webpage
(html) of the norg file in your browser. This is meant to act as a possible
start page (new tab) in your browser of choice. 

This script watches your norg file for changes and live-reloads the webpage.

# Running
1. Run `julia --project serve.jl` in order to start the server
2. Update the file `specs.norg` and see live updates
